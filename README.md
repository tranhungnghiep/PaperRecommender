# Paper Recommender
This is a general framework for relevant scientific paper recommendation. This framework was developed for experimental purpose in our research project.

Together with this framework, we have built seveval datasets for experiments of recommendation methods, crawled from http://academic.research.microsoft.com. These datasets are ready to be used with this framework.
