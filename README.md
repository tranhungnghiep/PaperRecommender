# Scientific Paper Recommender Systems
### Introduction
PaperRecommender is a general framework for relevant scientific paper recommendation, developed for experimental purpose in our research project. The source code was written in Java using Ant-based NetBeans project format, which can be opened in <a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a>. For the latest source code, please see the <a href="https://github.com/tranhungnghiep/PaperRecommender/tree/PaperRecommender_TestSite_NghiepTH_20141226">Test Site</a> branch.

We also built several datasets for scientific paper recommendation experiments based on a novel <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04422.pdf">method to build ground truth data</a>. These datasets contain metadata of over 4 million scientific papers in computer science, crawled from <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Academic Search</a> (MAS), finished in November 2012.
