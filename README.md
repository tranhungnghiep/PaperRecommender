# Scientific Paper Recommender Systems
### Introduction
PaperRecommender is a general framework for relevant scientific paper recommendation, developed for experimental purpose in our research project. The source code was written in Java using Ant-based NetBeans project format, which can be opened in <a href="https://netbeans.org/features/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a>.

We also built seveval datasets for scientific paper recommendation experiments based on a novel <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04422.pdf">method to build ground truth data</a>. The dataset contains metadata of over 4,000,000 scientific papers in computer science, crawled from <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>.
